# Bird-Eye-View
When human eyes see near things they look bigger as compare to those who are far away. This is called perspective in a general way. Whereas transformation is the transfer of an object e.t.c from one state to another.  So overall, the perspective transformation deals with the conversion of 3d world into 2d image. The same principle on which human vision works and the same principle on which the camera works.  We will see in detail about why this happens, that those objects which are near to you look bigger, while those who are far away, look smaller even though they look bigger when you reach them.
